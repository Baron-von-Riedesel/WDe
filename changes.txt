WDe V1.00 [__.__.2022]
  - rearranged startup code so there's no writing to the screen before
    main() has been reached; makes debuggers happy.
  - added timer.inc ( used by debug version )
  - wdex.com: restore pm interrupt vectors.
  - quick exit if no EGA/VGA detected.


WDe V0.99 [20.06.2022]
  - fixed: menu line restore after i/o error didn't work in v0.50.
  - fixed: to enter a cluster# in "goto cluster" did jump to a wrong
    cluster if cluster number contained a '9'.
  - fixed: Alt-Left at cluster 2 caused an error with a strange cluster#.
  - fixed: unformat FAT12/FAT16 didn't work in v0.50
  - fixed: unformat works for FAT32.
  - fixed: unformat may have stopped prematurely, leaving the disk in
    a corrupted state.
  - fixed: in v0.50, WDe had problems to handle image files correctly.
  - fixed: when restoring a file chain and the source file was a bit smaller
    than what's stored in the directory entry, WDe did show that last
    sector after the copy process.
  - fixed: function "find MBR" wasn't correct - did check 3 entries only,
    and assumed word at offset 1FCh to be 0000.
  - fixed: find MBR/BS/FAT/Dir displayed a wrong sector if the item was
    "found" in the current sector.
  - in directory view, files and directory names are displayed in different
    colors, the rest is darkened a bit ( light grey ).
  - filenames now accepted as cmdline parameters.
  - -m cmdline option may now be entered without number.
  - added option -8 to setm43.exe and setm432.exe.
  - debug version writes to debug terminal when running in a NTVDM.
    

WDe V0.50 [12.05.2022]
  - fixed: restore chain didn't work in v0.50pre1.
  - restore exFAT file chains implemented.
  - fixed: restore partition didn't restore last sector.
  - fixed: menuitem "unformat" removed for exFAT.
  - fixed: for "undelete", before the FAT is modified, it's first checked
    if there're enough free contiguous clusters at the required location;
    if no, the file is optionally truncated or the operation canceled.
    Hence error "File chain exceeds FAT" obsolete and removed.
  - fixed: in v0.50pre, the last cluster of exFAT was not accessible.
  - in FAT view, entries beyond last cluster# are displayed with "-".
  - with image files, bytes/sector are no longer fixed to 512.
  - exFAT primary file entries: created & modified timestamps displayed in view.
  - exFAT file stream entries: 64-bit file size fully displayed in view.
  - significant speed-up for "save to file" function.
  - in "save to file", file "chain", pressing TAB presets filename to enter
    with the filename from the directory entries.
  - up to 255 chars may be entered as long filenames in bottom line.
  - main menu: F1 display help now, "Save" moved to F7.
  - huge speed-up for "find" and "fill" (string & hex).
  - another variant of tool setm43, setm432, added.
  - check for invalid LFNs added in dirview.
  - screen color softened if no user input possible in main area.
  - in data region of FAT file systems, if the current cluster# is
    associated with a file ( that is, not a free cluster# ), it is shown
    in light green.
  - fixed: find MBR didn't work.
  - speed-up for "recurse" ( searching "linking" entry ) scan in FAT.
  - added navigation Ctrl-Enter in FAT: search directory entry with matching
    start cluster.
  - added navigation Ctrl-Right in data area: search previous cluster in
    chain.

WDe V0.50pre1 [24.04.2022]
  - the non-menu keys ( cursor movement, sector editing, ... )
    will work in all menus, not just in the main menu.
  - directory view changed, displays 1 item only, detects and shows
    LFN entries.
  - option -s ( safe mode ) added.
  - optionally build wdex.com, a WDe running as DPMI client.
  - fixed: recursing a chain searched "below" the current cluster only;
    this didn't guarantee that the linking cluster ( the predecessor )
    was found. OTOH, this fix has the effect that the recurse scan will
    take quite a bit longer if the current cluster is the start of a
    chain.
  - wdevdd.dll: adjusted to also work with protected-mode apps ( wdex.com ).
  - regression in v0.40: ctrl-left inside FAT didn't work if the entry
    was located in a different sector.
  - menu item "disk" moved to "file" submenu, new menu item "help" added
    to main menu.
  - wdevdd.dll got a significant speed-up, making lengthy operations 
    under WinXP/Vista ( "find", "fill", "recurse", ... ) usable.
  - fixed: logical disks with format NTFS are no longer handled like FAT disks.
  - support for exFAT file system implemented - it's experimental so far.
    Under DOS, to investigate exFAT partitions, one will heve to use the
    "restrict" option, since DOS itself doesn't know how to mount such
    partitions.
  - option -m ( mount partition as logical drive ) added.
  - string enter function has improved edit capabilities.
  - if available, WDe now uses LFN functions for file open/create.
  - Alt+Right/Left navigation ( forward/back 1 cluster ) added.

WDe V0.40 [13.04.2022]
  - decimal numbers now displayed without leading zeros.
  - input of numeric data is now checked only after the return key has
    been pressed.
  - fixed: find directory in v0.33 didn't update the screen until ESC
    has been pressed.
  - fixed: if the string to be found began at offset 0 of next sector,
    the cursor wasn't positioned correctly.
  - prompts for entering sectors/cluster show hints about valid range.
  - fixed: menu item "file ops" may have displayed a wrong submenu in
    v0.33 if current sector was in data region.
  - lengthy operations will display progress in bottom line.
  - memory model changed to small to increase data segment to 64 kB
    and allow to implement dynamically allocated buffers.
  - fixed: restoring file/fat chain gave wrong or misleading feedback.
  - string search fastened (but still room for improvements).
  - enclose current entry in directory view with '>' and '<'.
  - implemented a small (8 items) "sector stack" to be used by Ctrl-Up.
    Supposed to revert Enter, Ctrl-Enter or Ctrl-Left keys.

WDe V0.33 [01.04.2022]
  - set video attributes only in the 80x43 area in case current video mode
    has more rows/cols.
  - ensure that displays are done in current video page.
  - fixed: switching between hex and binary mode didn't clear the first data
    line.
  - fixed: if HD access had to use int 13h, ah=3 ("old" write function),
    a wrong address (read buffer instead of write buffer) was used.
  - added SETM43 tool. If it works with the graphics card, WDE's look
    might improve since a 8x14 font (instead of 8x8) is used then.
  - accept 'x:' or 'xH'/'xF' on the command line when WDe is started.
  - source changed to true tiny model (reduces binary size).
  - lot of "spaghetti" code cleaned.
  - find function will move cursor to the start of the found string.
  - Home/End key in main menu move cursor to start/end of current sector.
  - "find next" function added. Also, find will now start from cursor 
    position in current sector, not from the current sector's start.

WDe V0.32 [17.03.2022]
  - don't change video mode if current mode has at least 43 lines.
